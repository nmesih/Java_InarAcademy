/* (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off 
    speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to 
	take off using the following formula:
	
	lenght = v2 / 2a 
	
	Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the 
	acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length.
